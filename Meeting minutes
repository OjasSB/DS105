 Comments: 
 - constantly checking in with each other and having one platform to keep work up-to-date even scripts i.e. Git-Hub or Google Drive
 - inline with the comments about taking caution with adding new data and just trying to figure out a correlation //
   we should try and think about meaningful observations, hypothesise, then correlate
