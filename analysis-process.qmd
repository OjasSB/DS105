##### 6. Transform for Plotting 
    Create columns for difference, percentage differences, and catergorical variables 
##### 7. Visualisations 
    Create plots of MP's against population by month, and percentage difference between them. Create distributions. 
##### 8. Exploratory Data Analysis 
    Potential explanations of variations
